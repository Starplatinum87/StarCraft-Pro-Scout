# StarCraft-Pro-Scout - Player Ranking Classification

---

This is a machine learning project focused on exploring various algorithms to create models that can accurately classify the StarCraft league ranking of players based upon their performance in competitive matches. This is a supervised learning project that uses both non-parametric and parametric algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Logistic Regression. 

The overall goal is to create a model that can accurately predict which players have the potential to become professional StarCraft players. This kind of model can be very useful to StarCraft esports teams hoping to scout out the next potential StarCraft champion and can hopefully be more generalized to other esports.
